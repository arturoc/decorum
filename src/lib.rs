//! Making floating-point values behave: traits, ordering, equality, hashing,
//! and constraints for floating-point types.
//!
//! Decorum provides proxy (wrapper) types and functions that canonicalize
//! floating-point values and provide a total ordering. This allows
//! floating-point values to be hashed and compared. Proxy types also provide
//! contraints on the values that may be represented and will panic if those
//! constraints are violated. See the [README](https://docs.rs/crate/decorum/).
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! `NaN` and zero are canonicalized to a single representation (called `CNaN`
//! and `C0` respectively) to provide the following total ordering for all
//! proxy types and ordering functions:
//!
//! `[ -INF | ... | C0 | ... | +INF | CNaN ]`
//!
//! Note that `NaN` is canonicalized to `CNaN`, which has a single
//! representation and supports the relations `CNaN = CNaN` and `CNaN > x | x â‰ 
//! CNaN`. `+0` and `-0` are also canonicalized to `C0`, which is equivalent to
//! `+0`.
//!
//! # Constraints
//!
//! The `NotNan` and `Finite` types wrap raw floating-point values and disallow
//! certain values like `NaN`, `INF`, and `-INF`. They will panic if an
//! operation or conversion invalidates these constraints. The `Ordered` type
//! allows any valid IEEE-754 value (there are no constraints). For most use
//! cases, either `Ordered` or `NotNan` are appropriate.
